# Advanced-CPP-for-Multidisciplinary-Applications
Learning Advanced C++11/C++14 and Multidisciplinary Applications. 

I am in the process of moving my projects to GitHub so please ask me questions via msd228@cornell.edu if you find anything confusing. I was used to only put here files that I am testing online using RunMyCode but now I have been encouraged by friends to share my projects.
